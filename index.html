                Hi, Iâ€™m Tommie. Nice to meet you.
            </p>

            I am a new web developer based in Austin, Texas. With a large appetite for all things tech, I have had the opportunity to
            work for some tech startups which has ignited the fire to learn how to code. I look forward to integrating my
            past customer facing experience with design and development. When not coding, I can be found sweating in the
            gym or around Lady Bird Trail, meal prepping in the kitchen, exploring nearby state parks, or binge watching
            Netflix.
