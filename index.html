        <strong>Hi, I’m Tommie. Nice to meet you.</strong>
        <br> I am a new web developer based in Austin, Texas. With a large appetite for all things tech, I have had the opportunity
        to work for some tech startups which has ignited the fire to learn how to code. I look forward to integrating my
        past customer facing experience with design and development. When not coding, I can be found sweating in the gym
        or around Lady Bird Trail, meal prepping in the kitchen, exploring nearby state parks, or binge watching Netflix.
