            <strong>Hi, Iâ€™m Tommie. Nice to meet you.</strong>
            <p>
                I am a new web developer based in Austin, Texas. With a large appetite for all things tech, I have had the opportunity to
                work for some tech startups which has ignited the fire to learn how to code. I look forward to integrating
                my past customer facing experience with design and development.
            </p>
            When not coding, I can be found sweating in the gym or around Lady Bird Trail, meal prepping in the kitchen, exploring nearby
            state parks, or binge watching Netflix.
